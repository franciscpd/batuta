# Stack template: React

Conventions injected into briefs for React projects. Extends
`templates/generic.md`.

## Conventions for briefs

- Follow the project's existing state approach (props drilling, context,
  zustand, redux…).
- Components: PascalCase file and export names, one main component per file,
  colocate with the existing folder pattern (check neighbors before creating).
- Hooks: `use` prefix, rules of hooks respected.
- Styling: match the project's existing method (CSS modules, styled-components,
  Tailwind…).
- Derive state where possible; `useEffect` only for real external
  synchronization, with a complete dependency array.
- Tests: follow the project's runner (vitest/jest + testing-library). Query by
  role/label, not by test-id, unless the project already standardizes test-ids.

Never:

- Class components in new code.
- A second state or styling library alongside the project's existing one.
- Conditional hooks.
- `any` in a TypeScript project — type props and returns explicitly.

## Verification hints for the orchestrator

- Flag: missing `key` in lists, effects without cleanup where needed, state
  mutations, new dependencies not requested by the brief.
